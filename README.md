# Chat with Harry Potter (Or other PDFs) locally using Ollama
Testing out a Jupyter Notebook to test a local RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). Then developed into a version using a streamlit interface. First out testing and looking to improve on functionality, speeding up embedding and the answering of questions. Will also look to use alternative VectorDB to test out the performance of others.
